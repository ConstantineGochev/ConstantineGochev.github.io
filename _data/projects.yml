    Very small library that enables very easy handling of things like load balancing, proxying web sockets, dynamic routing and SSL encryption.
    AnchorGateway includes everything you need for easy reverse routing of your applications. Great for handling microservice routing from different domains in one single host, handling SSL and web sockets.
